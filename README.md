Game of SNAPS
The basic idea of Snaps is to spell out individual letters of a word using either a statement or a snap of your fingers. There are at least two players in Snaps. The snapper is the person who chooses a word and then snaps out the answer. The receiver is the person who listens to the snapper and guesses the word.

The console will play the role of the snapper and the user plays the role of the reciever.

Do your best to follow along.
